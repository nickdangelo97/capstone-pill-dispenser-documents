\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Document Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to define the minimum functional requirements for the Healthmate pill dispenser system. Meeting these requirements is the driving force behind system design and is a key success criteria for the project. These requirements are referenced in the System Design and Validation \& Verification documents.


\subsection{Project Purpose \& Scope}
The medication taken by an individual is only as effective as the abidance by the patient to take the prescribed medication at the times designated. The purpose of this project is to develop an integrated hardware and software system to improve the medication adherence for users who receive their prescriptions in sachet/pouch style packaging. This device will focus on dispensing PACMED pouches developed by McKesson Corporation. \par
The system to be implemented will provide real time alarms/reminders when it is time for the user to take their medication. The system will also dispense the user's medication in such a manor as to make it easy to retrieve and ingest. Once a scheduled dose has been taken/missed the system will record adherence data. This data will be stored locally on the device.\par
This project's scope consists of four main components. A general overview of each component can be found below:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item System to insert strip packaged medication into the device.
    \item System for dispensing individual packages from a strip package.
    \item Embedded control system that initiates dispensing, reads user interactions, and collects data.
    \item User interface for user information and settings control.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Operational Overview}
A individual will insert their PACMED strip package into the device, aligning the first pouch with an alignment groove. After insertion they will be prompted to set their preferred dispensing times within predefined ranges for morning, lunch, supper and bedtime doses. When it is time for a scheduled dose an audible alarm will activate. Upon alarm acknowledgement, the device will cut open and dispense the required pouch/pouches, and the user can freely remove their medication from the device. Under normal operation, dispensing events will continue to occur at the specified times until all pouches have been dispensed from the device. \par
The user may interact with an interface on the device. Through this interface they will be able to modify the dispensing schedule, initiate manual dispense requests and view adherence data.

\end{itemize}
\bigskip
Normal Operation:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item The device will monitor the collection sensor. If collection is detected, a timestamp in the proper format will be created and written to memory with a dispensed tag. If not collection occurs after a specified timeout a missed dose tag will be attached to the written timestamp.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
Undesired Event Handling:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item A non-dispensing event triggers the collection sensor
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The system will check if a dispensing state had just completed successfully. If not, the trigger would be ignored.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

%-----------------------
\subsubsection*{FR6: The dispenser must keep an accurate real-time clock.}
Rationale: A non-accurate RTC can cause undesired dispense actions to occur. A configurable RTC will allow the user to set the device time to their local time.
\\\\
Variables of interest:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item m\_DateTime
\end{itemize} 
\bigskip
Performance Requirements:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item The onboard RTC should tick in reference to the date and time specified by the user.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
Normal Operation:

    \item On first startup, the device would allow the user to set the current device time to their local time. The RTC time will then be displayed on the UI and tick accordingly.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
Undesired Event Handling:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item RTC clock becomes out-of-sync (e.g. unexpected device shutdown).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The user will be forced to update the onboard RTC. The device will then ensure the next pouch to dispense is correct and notify accordingly.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

%-----------------------
\subsubsection*{FR7: The dispenser must be able to hold and dispense McKesson PACMED strip packages.}
Rationale: Ensuring the device is designed to hold the strip packages securely will ensure the package into a undesirable position.
\\\\
Variables of interest:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item k\_StripPackageLength
    \item k\_StripPackageWidth
    \item k\_StripPackageHeight

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item After a successful dispense occurs, a visible notification will be displayed on the device and an audible tone will be emitted.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
Undesired Event Handling:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item Alarm fails to fire or dismiss.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The device will perform a soft reset.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

%-----------------------
\subsubsection*{FR9: The dispenser must allow the user to manually dispense pouches as necessary.}
Rationale: If the user is going to be away from the machine during their dispensing periods, they are still required to take their medication.
\\\\
Variables of interest:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item m\_UserInputs
\end{itemize} 
\bigskip
Performance Requirements:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]

\bigskip
Undesired Event Handling:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item The requested dispense is not performed.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The undesired event handling from FR4 should be followed.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\bigskip


%-----------------------
\subsubsection*{FR10: The dispenser must allow the user to update the current dispensing schedule as necessary.}
Rationale: Dispensing times should be at the convince of the user, not the device.
\\\\
Variables of interest:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item m\_DispensingSchedule
\end{itemize} 
\bigskip
Performance Requirements:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item The user should be able to retrieve the current state of the monitored variable and configure the values to their needs. The device should store this variable locally.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
Normal Operation:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item The user will trigger the edit dispense times page through a button press. This page will display the current dispense times  along with an edit button for each time. A button press on the edit button will display the increment/decrement time buttons to make the necessary changes.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
Undesired Event Handling:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item Save/load data is corrupted.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The user will be notified that the data was corrupted and force the user to set new values.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

%-----------------------
\subsubsection*{FR11:  The dispenser must store adherence data on local non-volatile memory.}
Rationale: Storing the data locally and in non-volatile memory ensures data will be available regardless of unexpected device events. 
\\\\
Variables of interest:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item c\_AdherenceStatistics
\end{itemize} 
\bigskip
Performance Requirements:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item On change of the monitored variable, the device must store the new data in its local non-volatile memory.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
Normal Operation:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item When a new adherence statistic is available, it will be stored on-board the device.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
Undesired Event Handling:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item Save/load data is corrupted.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The user will be notified that the data was corrupted. The sector of memory will be cleared.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

%-----------------------
\subsubsection*{FR12:  The user must be able to see adherence data via the user interface or through a direct connection to the device (ex.  USB).}
Rationale: Once collected the user and/or their caregiver must be able see/extract adherence data so they can gain insight into the user's habits.
