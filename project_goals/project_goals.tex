\section{Project Overview}
As a person begins to age, there is often an increase in the amount of medication taken to keep healthy. However, the medication taken is only as effective as the abidance by the patient to take the prescribed medication at the designated times. Non-adherence to prescribed medicines can lead to further health complications; along with unnecessary visits to physicians and avoidable health costs. 

Apex Engineering is partnering with Precision Medicines Corporations to develop a smart pill dispenser to help with the non-adherence of prescription pills that many individuals face. The pill dispenser will be paired with the PACMED pill strip packs and will index, cut and dispense the desired strip pack at a user specified time in a dispensing period (breakfast, lunch, supper or bedtime). The dispenser will also keep track of adherence and collection data for the user to review at a later time.

 \textbf{Goal} & \textbf{Goal Description} & \textbf{Importance of Goal} \\ 
 \hline
 PG1 &
   Dispense opened medication pouches into designated area of the device in adherence with a predefined schedule. &
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,leftmargin=13pt]
  \item Adherence and collection data is more attainable through one area of collection.
  \item Medication dispensed only when requested.
  \item User has easier access to medication.
  \item User does not have to worry about/struggle to open pouches itself.
  \end{itemize}\\ 
 \hline
 PG2 &
 The user will be able to interact with the device through a user interface which will allow them to view/change parameters. & 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,leftmargin=13pt]
  \item This interaction will allow user to set parameters that fits their needs (e.g. dispense times)
  \end{itemize}\\ 
 \hline
 PG3 &
The device will aim to improve medication adherence through the use of various tools (e.g. notifications, data collection)  & 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,leftmargin=13pt] 
  \item Improving the medication adherence of end users is the primary motivation for the project.
