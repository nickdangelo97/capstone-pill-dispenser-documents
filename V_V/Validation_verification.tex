\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose of Document}
The purpose of the following document is to aid in the development and testing of the Healthmate pill dispenser. The primary focus of the testing will be to validate the product and to verify that it meets the proposed system requirements. This process is intended to ensure that the product is functioning as expected and that it meets the needs of the end user.

\subsection{Scope}
The systems that will be tested in this document are a revised list taken from the system design document. The modules from this document have been grouped into the following buckets for testing: GUI, Backend and Mechanical. Majority of the test cases outlined were done using a black-box testing methodology, with white-box tests added as deemed necessary.

\subsection{Background}
The Healthmate pill dispenser is a table top home medical appliance designed to aid seniors with medication adherence. This dispenser focuses on dispensing sachet style medication, specifically McKesson Corporation's PACMED strip packages.  \par
Healthmate's basic operation consists of the ability to alarm/notify a user when it is time to take their medication. Upon acknowledgement of the notification, Healthmate will cut open and dispense the appropriate pill sachet(s) for the user. Throughout operation, data will be collected by Healthmate to monitor the user's medication adherence. \par
To date, the core elements and key design considerations for Healthmate have been outlined in the Project Goals, System Requirements, Hazard Analysis and System Design.

\subsection{Road map}
Verification and validation is the final step of the Revision 0 design process. Considerations from this testing will be carried forward as the team begins Revision 1 of the project. Please see Figure 1 for a full project road-map.

\section{Components to be Tested}

\subsection{GUI}
    The GUI will be tested as follows: all reusable components will be assigned test cases to ensure their base functionality is validated. Then test cases for where these modules are used will also be included. Also, if not covered in the previously defined testing scenario, each `View' will also be assigned test cases to ensure all interactions provide the proper functionality to the user.
     \begin{itemize}
        \item Views
        \begin{itemize}
            \item ReadyView
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Will display current time, next dispense time, interactions to view current dispense times and request a manual dispensing of medication.
                \item Note: At this time, a successful manual dispense call will be simulated with a signal to the onboard LED. In the next revision, this button will be hidden behind a menu screen for saftey precautions. 
            \end{itemize}
            \item SetRTCView
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Consists of SetTimeModule for setting RTC time. Test included included in SetTime module test cases.
            \end{itemize}
            \item SetDispenseTimeView
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Consists of SetTimeModule for setting specified dispense time. Test included included in SetTime module test cases.
            \end{itemize}
            \item CurrentDispenseTimesView
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Consists of several DispenseTimeWidgets. Test included included in DispenseTimeWidgets module test cases.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \item Reusable Modules
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  SetTime module
            \begin{itemize}
                \item  The SetTime Module is a reusable UI module that allows the users to create TimeStamps. The module consists of increase and decrease buttons for hour and minute, respectively. The component also allows the user to toggle A.M./P.M. This functionality will be the basis of correctness. On confirmation, the module creates a TimeStamp consisting of the hour, minute and am/pm value set by the user and passes it along to a custom callback defined elsewhere. This module is currently used in the SetRTCView and SetDispsenseSceen. Tests for the required functionality of these Views can be found in the last rows of the SetTime Module test case.

            \end{itemize}
            
            \item DispenseTimeWidget
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The DispenseTimeWidget is a reusable component specifically used in the ViewDispenseTimesView. It consists of a label describing the time period, a clock showing the set dispense time, and an `Edit' button that will allow the user to transition to the SetDispenseView for that period. 
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        
\subsection{Backend}
The backend system consists of call board interactions given changes in the monitored variables. This system will be tested by varying all values of the monitored variables and ensuring the proper functionality is conducted based off these changes.

\subsection{Mechanical}
The mechanical system will consist of motors, optical sensors, and a cutting device attached to a ball-screw. This system will be tested by sending signals from the backend to the mechanical system and ensuring that the correct psychical actions are taken and the correct output from the optical sensors are received on the backend.

\section{Beyond Testing}

\subsection{Code Walk-through and Code Reviews}
After a feature was considered complete and ready to review, a merge request was made through GitLab, and 2 reviewers who had not worked on the feature are assigned to the request. All three members would then engage in a code review where the author would explain functionality and the implementation at hand. The reviewers would then ask questions to challenge the authors implementation. Once all commits are agreed upon, the request would be merged into the main branch.

\subsection{Results of Peer Reviews}

The previously mentioned code review process has also been used for much of the development of the rest of the project. This style of review has allowed for further brainstorming of solutions and has allowed for different solutions to be viewed from different perspectives.

\section{Traceability Matrix}
The following traceability matrix may be used to map the above test cases to the corresponding requirements they cover. For the purposes of readability the abbreviations FR and NFR have been used for Functional and Non-functional requirements (ex. FR1 corresponds to function requirement 1, and NFR3 to non-functional requirement 3).
